System injects an audio-input into a carrier signal, and then uses a flyback transformer from a CRT to step-up the signal voltage by several orders of magnitude. The result is an electrical arc across the anode and cathode of the CRT that audibly outputs the injected sound. Project partners for this were Owen Vita and Bader Alenesi.",
